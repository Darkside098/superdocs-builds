### Formatting Preservation and Fidelity

**Status: COMPLETE**

- [x] Detectable paragraph formatting preservation

>
> PDF loader is not currently implemented in this branch.
>
> No template-inference API endpoint is currently implemented in this branch.

## Validation

### Full Test Suite

```text
304 passed
```

- [x] PDF loader is not currently implemented.
- [x] No template-inference API endpoint is currently implemented in this branch.
